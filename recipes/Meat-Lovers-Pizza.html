        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare dough by combining warm water, heated to 115 degrees fahrenheit, with yeast and sugar. Stir to dissolve and allow to proof.</li>
                <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, add flour and salt. With mixer running on low, slowly add yeast mixture. Increase speed, adding olive oil, if needed or desired. Mix until a ball forms, pulling away from the sides of the bowl. Transfer to a greased bowl. Cover and allow to rise in a warm location until doubled, roughly 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, cook bacon and sausage. Chop bacon and ham. Crumble sausage.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
                <li>Grease a baking sheet with olive oil. Shape dough to desired size. Spoon pizza sauce over dough. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and 1/2 cup shredded whole milk mozzzarella. Add meat toppings. Finally sprinkle with remaining 1 cup mozzarella and ground black pepper.</li>
                <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes or until desired crispness is reached. Serve warm.</li>
